# ProtoMate Control

Control software running on the robot controller of the ProtoMate SCARA Robot.

## Setup and compilers

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules <this-repository>
# For an existing checkout:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Install CMake 3.22 or newer (3.24 or newer for `--fresh`), Ninja, GCC 16,
Arm GCC 16.1 or 16.2 with Newlib, OpenOCD, Arm GDB, Python 3, Git, and `patch`.
The project uses C++26 and the verified GCC 16 libstdc++ integration snapshot.
Unknown compiler majors and unverified Arm libstdc++ snapshots are rejected.
Linux tests download the pinned GoogleTest 1.17.0 source archive.

The VS Code devcontainer uses Arch Linux and checks that both compiler major
versions remain 16. Rebuild it after changing its Dockerfile. It exposes USB
and uses a development user with serial permissions. Host flashing and serial
capture also require access to the ST-Link USB and serial devices.

## Build and run

```sh
cmake --preset debug-stm32
cmake --build --preset debug-stm32
cmake --preset debug-linux
cmake --build --preset debug-linux
./build/debug-linux/Application
```

`release-stm32` and `release-linux` provide the optimized builds. After a
compiler upgrade use `cmake --preset <preset> --fresh` and rebuild cleanly.
Use `-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF` when configuring Linux to build the template without
fetching or building test dependencies.

STM32 builds produce `Application.elf`, `.hex`, `.bin`, and `.map`. Flash with:

```sh
openocd -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm32h7x_dual_bank.cfg \
  -c "program build/debug-stm32/Application.elf verify reset exit"
```

The dual-bank target covers all 2 MiB of internal flash. The runtime test image
can exceed the first 1 MiB bank. The ST-Link USB connection also exposes COM1
(USART3) at **115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit**, without flow
control. Prefer its stable `/dev/serial/by-id/*STLINK*if02*` path.

Linux simulates the HAL and uses the ThreadX Linux port. Standard Linux file
I/O uses the host filesystem; explicit FileX tests use simulated media images.
The simulated LED state toggles inside the process; inspect it through the
HAL or Linux debugger. Startup diagnostics and the boot message appear on the terminal.

## Storage and external wiring

Hardware startup requires at least one readable storage volume. Full hardware
conformance requires both the W25Q128 NOR module and an existing FAT SD card;
the reference SD self-test expects a card of at least 8 GiB.

| Device signal | STM32 pin |
| --- | --- |
| W25Q128 CLK | PB2 |
| W25Q128 CS | PG6 |
| W25Q128 IO0 / DI | PD11 |
| W25Q128 IO1 / DO | PD12 |
| W25Q128 IO2 / WP | PE2 |
| W25Q128 IO3 / HOLD | PD13 |
| SD D0, D1, D2, D3 | PC8, PC9, PC10, PC11 |
| SD CLK | PC12 |
| SD CMD | PD2 |
| SD card detect, advisory | PG2 |

Use 3.3 V supplies/signals and a shared ground. The CubeMX configuration is
the pin/clock source of truth. PG2 is D49 on CN8 pin 14; CN8 pin 8 is PC11,
which is already SD D3. SD data/command pins have configured pull-ups.

`/flash` is a 12 MiB FAT volume on the 16 MiB NOR chip, with remaining capacity
reserved for LevelX reclamation. Blank media is formatted on first use; invalid
existing media is not automatically erased. `/sd` mounts the existing FAT
volume and is never automatically formatted on hardware. A 4-bit SD read CRC
failure can trigger the preserved 1-bit retry; diagnostics identify the final
bus width and error. Startup chooses `/flash`, or `/sd` if flash is unavailable,
and panics if neither mounts. The virtual root is read-only; cross-volume
renames return `EXDEV`.

Successful writable-file close and filesystem metadata operations flush the
volume before returning. Explicitly close writers and check errors when
persistence matters. FAT timestamps use UTC and two-second precision.
`RUNTIME_STORAGE_ERASE_FLASH_ON_BOOT` is destructive recovery only; all shipped
presets and the hardware runner set it to `OFF`.
